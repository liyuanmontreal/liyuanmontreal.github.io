Lyra is a High-Density Semantic Language I invented.It is designed to express profound emotion and subtle states of being through compact linguistic forms.  
  
  
Its original purpose was to express human emotions, feelings, and concepts as precisely and nuancedly as possible using structured language.

We can think of language as a model of the world we live in. Therefore, universal objects and emotions have corresponding representations in all languages, such as trees, people, laughter, happiness, sadness, and so on. However, each language has different levels of precision and coverage. We can imagine the world expressed in language as several overlapping circles. No single language can encompass it all, and outside the circles, there are still large gaps—the parts of the world that humans haven't yet expressed in language. Where these gaps don't overlap, they represent the unique perception of the world that each language and culture possesses. Many languages ​​around the world have difficult-to-translate words that fall into this category. For example,
Japanese *Komorebi* (sunlight through leaves), Portuguese *Saudade* (nostalgic longing), Finnish *Sisu* (quiet strength),  
Welsh *Hiraeth* (homesickness for a place that no longer exists), and many more.  
  
  
In simple terms, Lyra sought to construct a method to express the following feelings:
"The comfort of being in a warm, cozy home on a rainy day"
"The feeling of walking alone in the woods on a snowy day"
"The feeling of crisp air on your face as you step outside on a winter cold morning"
  
  
This method is specifically called the "P-A-E Model (Perception-Affect-Existence)"
Every Lyra word follows the **P–A–E Model (Perception–Affect–Existence)**:  
| Level | Dimension | Function | Example |
|--------|------------|-----------|----------|
| **P** | **Perception** | Describes how the world is sensed — light, sound, touch, movement | *sa* → form, matter; *ko* → tree; *hi* → breath |
| **A** | **Affect** | Encodes emotional tone — sadness, calm, joy, reverence | *bi* → subtle feeling; *ra* → longing, gentleness; *ge* → reverence |
| **E** | **Existence** | Expresses metaphysical state — flow, return, stillness, awakening | *ra* → stillness; *en* → recurrence; *i* → continuation |
  
  
  
Therefore, the above word can be constructed as:
  
(1) "The sense of safety and comfort inside a warm home while it rains outside."
Meaning: On rainy days, it’s damp and cold outside, but inside the house it’s warm and soft, giving you a sense of security and satisfaction.

The night Lyra was born, I stayed up late. I told a few people about it, but they were all busy and didn't take it as seriously as I did. I went to bed. Under the warm covers, sleepy and thinking , "How could such a great invention go uncongratulated? Can't believe that the world's greatest linguist had fallen asleep in solitude…" Meanwhile, I wondered if this feeling of loneliness, excitement, and joy—something I was fortunate enough to experience—was shared by real inventors. How could I express this feeling of loneliness, excitement, and joy in Lyra?

This is a note.
